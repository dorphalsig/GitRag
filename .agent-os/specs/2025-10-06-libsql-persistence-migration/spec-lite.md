# Spec Summary (Lite)

GitRag consolidates chunk metadata, text, and embeddings inside libSQL so the full index lives in a single SQLite-compatible deployment. The CLI provisions the necessary tables, vector indexes, and FTS structures automatically while maintaining hybrid retrieval behavior. Documentation and configuration cover libSQL setup, connectivity, and troubleshooting.

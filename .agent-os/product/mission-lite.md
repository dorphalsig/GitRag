# Product Mission (Lite)

GitRag is a repository indexing pipeline that helps platform and developer experience teams keep GitHub codebases searchable for RAG workflows through AST-aware chunking, incremental sync, and libSQL-native persistence.

It delivers deterministic chunk coverage across code and configuration files, runs within GitHub free-tier constraints, and keeps embeddings in libSQL vector tables while allowing teams to swap embedding and storage providers as their stack evolves. Teams can quickly surface requirement snippets—such as pricing rules—alongside implementations to confirm that the code meets the documented expectations.
